# Smart-Home-Automation-System

# Introduction

This Git repository contains the codebase for a Smart Home Automation System. The system aims to automate household management tasks and provide users with notifications based on predefined rules and events.
This project is a database management system (DBMS) project that explores various SQL queries and demonstrates their implementation within a relational database management system. The project encompasses the design of a database schema for a smart home automation system, along with the creation of tables, insertion of sample data, and execution of SQL queries to perform data manipulation and retrieval operations.
SQL script provided in this repository for this project will give more details.

# Features:

User Management: Users can create accounts and manage their personal information.<br>
House Management: Users can add and manage houses, including details like address and room setup.<br>
Room and Device Management: Users can configure rooms within their houses and add devices to control.<br>
Automation Rules: Users can define rules for automating device actions based on specified conditions.<br>
Event Notifications: Users receive notifications for events such as motion detection or temperature changes.<br>


# ER-Data Requirement
The system's data structure includes entities such as User, House, Room, Device, Automation Rule, Event Notification, and Event Type, each with specific attributes and relationships.

# Logical Model
The logical model outlines primary keys, foreign keys, and attributes for each entity, facilitating database design and implementation.

# Database Schema
The database schema consists of the following tables:

Users: Stores information about users of the smart home automation system, including their names, contact details, and unique identifiers.<br>
Houses: Contains details about residential properties, such as addresses, location, and ownership.<br>
UserHouses: Represents the relationship between users and houses, indicating the roles of users within specific properties.<br>
DeviceTypes: Defines the types of devices that can be installed in a smart home setup.<br>
Devices: Stores information about individual smart devices, including their types, manufacturers, and purchase details.<br>
DeviceStates: Records the state of each device at different timestamps, capturing data such as temperature, status, or motion detection.<br>
Rooms: Describes the rooms within each house, associated with specific users.<br>
AutomationRules: Contains predefined rules for automating actions based on certain triggers and conditions.<br>
UserAutomationRules: Maps users to automation rules and specifies their permission levels for rule execution.<br>
EventTypes: Defines different types of events that can occur within the system.<br>
EventNotifications: Stores notifications generated by various events, along with timestamps.<br>
UserEventNotifications: Associates users with event notifications and their preferred notification preferences.<br>

# SQL Queries
The project includes a wide range of SQL queries categorized into different types, including:

Data Retrieval Queries: Retrieve information from one or more tables using SELECT statements, often involving joins, filtering, and ordering.<br>
Data Modification Queries: Insert, update, or delete records to modify the database contents, ensuring data integrity and consistency.<br>
Data Aggregation Queries: Perform aggregations and calculations on data sets using functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.<br>
Data Manipulation Queries: Utilize built-in functions and operators to transform and manipulate data according to specific requirements.<br>
Transaction Management: Implement transactions to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) when performing multiple database operations.<br>
Stored Procedures and Functions: Define reusable routines for executing complex operations or calculations within the database.<br>
Views: Create virtual tables that abstract and simplify complex data structures, providing a convenient way to query data from multiple tables.<br>
These SQL queries cover various scenarios, including retrieving user and house information, managing smart devices and automation rules, handling event notifications, and implementing transactional operations.<br>
