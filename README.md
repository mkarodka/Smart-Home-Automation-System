# Smart-Home-Automation-System

# Introduction

This Git repository contains the codebase for a Smart Home Automation System. The system aims to automate household management tasks and provide users with notifications based on predefined rules and events.
This project is a database management system (DBMS) project that explores various SQL queries and demonstrates their implementation within a relational database management system. The project encompasses the design of a database schema for a smart home automation system, along with the creation of tables, insertion of sample data, and execution of SQL queries to perform data manipulation and retrieval operations.
SQL script provided in this repository for this project will give more details.

# Business Description:
The project aims to revolutionize the way homeowners manage and interact with their smart home devices. We are developing a Smart Home Automation System that centralizes device control, automation, and monitoring into a user-friendly platform. Our goal is to enhance the convenience, energy efficiency, and security of homes through intelligent automation.

# Problem Statement:
With the proliferation of smart home devices, homeowners often face challenges in managing and coordinating these devices effectively. Users need a unified platform to control and automate devices seamlessly. Current solutions lack the ability to provide a centralized control system for diverse smart devices.

# Proposed Solution:
We propose the development of a Smart Home Automation System with the following features:
•	User Management: Allow users to register, create profiles, and manage their smart homes.<br>
•	Device Integration: Support a wide range of smart devices, including lights, thermostats, cameras, and sensors<br>
•	Device Control: Enable users to control devices individually or in groups<br>
•	Automation Rules: Allow users to create custom automation rules based on triggers and actions.<br>
•	Event Notifications: Provide real-time event notifications (e.g., motion detection, door openings)<br>
•	Energy Efficiency: Offer insights into device usage patterns to help users optimize energy consumption<br>
•	User-Friendly Interface: Develop a responsive and intuitive user interface for web and mobile devices<br>

# Target Users:
Our Smart Home Automation System is designed for:<br>
•	Homeowners and renters with smart home devices.<br>
•	Individuals looking to enhance energy efficiency and security in their homes.<br>
•	Tech-savvy users interested in home automation.<br>

# ER-Data Requirement
The system's data structure includes entities such as User, House, Room, Device, Automation Rule, Event Notification, and Event Type, each with specific attributes and relationships.

# Database Schema
The database schema consists of the following tables:

Users: Stores information about users of the smart home automation system, including their names, contact details, and unique identifiers.<br>
Houses: Contains details about residential properties, such as addresses, location, and ownership.<br>
UserHouses: Represents the relationship between users and houses, indicating the roles of users within specific properties.<br>
DeviceTypes: Defines the types of devices that can be installed in a smart home setup.<br>
Devices: Stores information about individual smart devices, including their types, manufacturers, and purchase details.<br>
DeviceStates: Records the state of each device at different timestamps, capturing data such as temperature, status, or motion detection.<br>
Rooms: Describes the rooms within each house, associated with specific users.<br>
AutomationRules: Contains predefined rules for automating actions based on certain triggers and conditions.<br>
UserAutomationRules: Maps users to automation rules and specifies their permission levels for rule execution.<br>
EventTypes: Defines different types of events that can occur within the system.<br>
EventNotifications: Stores notifications generated by various events, along with timestamps.<br>
UserEventNotifications: Associates users with event notifications and their preferred notification preferences.<br>

# SQL Queries
The project includes a wide range of SQL queries categorized into different types, including:

Data Retrieval Queries: Retrieve information from one or more tables using SELECT statements, often involving joins, filtering, and ordering.<br>
Data Modification Queries: Insert, update, or delete records to modify the database contents, ensuring data integrity and consistency.<br>
Data Aggregation Queries: Perform aggregations and calculations on data sets using functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.<br>
Data Manipulation Queries: Utilize built-in functions and operators to transform and manipulate data according to specific requirements.<br>
Transaction Management: Implement transactions to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) when performing multiple database operations.<br>
Stored Procedures and Functions: Define reusable routines for executing complex operations or calculations within the database.<br>
Views: Create virtual tables that abstract and simplify complex data structures, providing a convenient way to query data from multiple tables.<br>
These SQL queries cover various scenarios, including retrieving user and house information, managing smart devices and automation rules, handling event notifications, and implementing transactional operations.<br>
